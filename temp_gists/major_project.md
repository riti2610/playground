# Proposal title 1 
## NGO management application

# Description

We want to develop a comprehension solution for a small or large scale ngo's to register children records and family records and also devise solution to their economic resource planning. 
We are trying to provide the ngo a full fledged app that will manage their data and also provide solution to form welfare campaigns like collecting donations and sharing the details of the beneficiaries to public and promote transparency as a organization.

Core Objectives:

    Child Management:
        Store detailed records of each child, including personal information, health records, educational progress, and history within the NGO.
        Track attendance, participation in programs, and other activities.

    Donor Management:
        Maintain records of donors, including contact information, donation history, and communication logs.
        Generate and send receipts or thank-you notes to donors.
        Create reports on donation trends and funds received.

    Volunteer Management:
        Manage volunteer profiles, skills, availability, and participation in events or programs.
        Track volunteer hours and contributions to the NGO.

    Program and Event Management:
        Organize and manage programs, workshops, or events for children.
        Track participation and outcomes of these programs.
        Send notifications or reminders to participants and staff.

    Financial Management:
        Record and track expenses related to various programs and operations.
        Generate financial reports and ensure transparency in fund usage.
        Manage budgets and plan future expenses.

    Case Management:
        Create and manage cases for children who need special attention (e.g., health interventions, legal support).
        Track the progress of each case, including updates and outcomes.


# Proposal 2 

## Visualizing Genomic Sequences: ex SARS-CoV-2 

# Description
1. Data Collection:

    Genomic Sequences: Obtain SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences from databases like GISAID, NCBI GenBank, or Ensembl.
    Metadata: Ensure you have metadata associated with each sequence, such as the date, location, and variant name.

2. Data Processing:

    Sequence Alignment: Use tools like Clustal Omega or MAFFT for multiple sequence alignment. This helps identify mutations and differences between sequences.
    Variant Calling: Use tools like bcftools to call variants (mutations) between sequences.

3. Analysis:

    Mutation Frequency: Calculate the frequency of each mutation across different sequences.
    Phylogenetic Analysis: Build a phylogenetic tree using tools like MEGA or PhyML to show evolutionary relationships.

4. Visualization:

    Mutation Heatmap: Create a heatmap to visualize mutation frequencies across different genomic regions.
    Phylogenetic Tree: Display the phylogenetic tree showing relationships between different strains.
    Geographic Visualization: Map the spread of different variants using geographic data.

5. Tools and Libraries:

    Python Libraries: Pandas (data manipulation), Biopython (genomic data handling), Matplotlib/Seaborn (visualization), and Plotly (interactive plots).
    R Libraries: ggplot2, dplyr, and ape (for phylogenetics).

6. Presentation:

    Interactive Dashboard: Use tools like Dash or Streamlit to create a web-based interactive dashboard to present your findings.


# Proposal 3 

## Solar System Visualizer

# Description

Develop an interactive solar system visualizer that helps children understand the structure and dynamics of the solar system. This tool will use visual and interactive elements to illustrate planetary orbits, sizes, and relative distances. Key Features:      3D Solar System Model:         Interactive Visualization: Create a 3D model of the solar system with planets, moons, and the Sun. Users can rotate, zoom, and explore different parts of the system.         Planetary Orbits: Show the elliptical orbits of planets around the Sun and allow users to see how the planets move over time.      Planetary Information:         Interactive Planets: Clicking on a planet will display detailed information such as size, distance from the Sun, atmospheric composition, and interesting facts.         Educational Pop-ups: Provide fun facts, images, and brief descriptions for each planet and moon.      Scale and Distance Representation:         Scaled Models: Use relative sizes and distances to help children understand the vast differences between the planets and their distances from the Sun.         Distance Slider: Implement a slider to adjust the scale of distances to fit the screen while maintaining relative proportions.      Animated Orbits:         Orbital Animation: Animate the orbits of the planets to show their movement around the Sun. This can help visualize concepts like revolution and rotation.         Time Controls: Allow users to fast-forward or rewind time to see how planets move over different periods.      Educational Games and Quizzes:         Interactive Games: Include simple games like “Planet Matching” or “Orbit Quiz” to reinforce learning in a fun way.         Quizzes: Add quizzes about planetary facts, the solar system, and astronomical concepts to test knowledge.
